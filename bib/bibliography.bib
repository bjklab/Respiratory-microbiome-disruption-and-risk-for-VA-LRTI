  abstract = "OBJECTIVE To characterize the microbial disruption indices of
              hospitalized patients to predict colonization with
              multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs). DESIGN A cross-sectional
              survey of the fecal microbiome was conducted in a tertiary
              referral, acute-care hospital in Boston, Massachusetts.
              PARTICIPANTS The study population consisted of adult patients
              hospitalized in general medical/surgical wards. METHODS Rectal
              swabs were obtained from patients within 48 hours of hospital
              admission and screened for MDRO colonization using conventional
              culture techniques. The V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was
              sequenced to assess the fecal microbiome. Microbial diversity and
              composition, as well as the functional potential of the microbial
              communities present in fecal samples, were compared between
              patients with and without MDRO colonization. RESULTS A total of
              44 patients were included in the study, of whom 11 (25\%) were
              colonized with at least 1 MDRO. Reduced microbial diversity and
              high abundance of metabolic pathways associated with
              multidrug-resistance mechanisms characterized the fecal
              microbiome of patients colonized with MDRO at hospital admission.
              CONCLUSIONS Our data suggest that microbial disruption indices
              may be key to predicting MDRO colonization and could provide
              novel infection control approaches. Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol

              relationship between hyperoxia, lung and gut microbiota, and lung
              injury is unknown. Here, we show that hyperoxia conferred a
              selective relative growth advantage on oxygen-tolerant
              respiratory microbial species (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus) as
              demonstrated by an observational study of critically ill patients
              receiving mechanical ventilation and experiments using neonatal
              and adult mouse models. During exposure of mice to hyperoxia,
              both lung and gut bacterial communities were altered, and these
              communities contributed to oxygen-induced lung injury. Disruption
              of lung and gut microbiota preceded lung injury, and variation in
              microbial communities correlated with variation in lung
              inflammation. Germ-free mice were protected from oxygen-induced
              lung injury, and systemic antibiotic treatment selectively
              modulated the severity of oxygen-induced lung injury in
              conventionally housed animals. These results suggest that inhaled

  abstract = "UNLABELLED: No studies have examined the relationships between
              bacterial communities along sites of the upper aerodigestive
              tract of an individual subject. Our objective was to perform an
              intrasubject and intersite analysis to determine the
              contributions of two upper mucosal sites (mouth and nose) as
              source communities for the bacterial microbiome of lower sites
              (lungs and stomach). Oral wash, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)
              fluid, nasal swab, and gastric aspirate samples were collected
              from 28 healthy subjects. Extensive analysis of controls and
              serial intrasubject BAL fluid samples demonstrated that sampling
              of the lungs by bronchoscopy was not confounded by oral
              microbiome contamination. By quantitative PCR, the oral cavity
              and stomach contained the highest bacterial signal levels and the
              nasal cavity and lungs contained much lower levels.
              Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicon libraries generated from
              these samples showed that the oral and gastric compartments had
              the greatest species richness, which was significantly greater in
              both than the richness measured in the lungs and nasal cavity.
              The bacterial communities of the lungs were significantly
              different from those of the mouth, nose, and stomach, while the
              greatest similarity was between the oral and gastric communities.
              However, the bacterial communities of healthy lungs shared
              significant membership with the mouth, but not the nose, and
              marked subject-subject variation was noted. In summary, microbial
              immigration from the oral cavity appears to be the significant
              source of the lung microbiome during health, but unlike the
              stomach, the lungs exhibit evidence of selective elimination of
              Prevotella bacteria derived from the upper airways. IMPORTANCE:
              We have demonstrated that the bacterial communities of the
              healthy lung overlapped those found in the mouth but were found
              at lower concentrations, with lower membership and a different
              community composition. The nasal microbiome, which was distinct
              from the oral microbiome, appeared to contribute little to the
              composition of the lung microbiome in healthy subjects. Our
              studies of the nasal, oral, lung, and stomach microbiomes within
              an individual illustrate the microbiological continuity of the
              aerodigestive tract in healthy adults and provide
              culture-independent microbiological support for the concept that
              microaspiration is common in healthy individuals.",

               clusters of sequencing reads that differ by less than a fixed
               dissimilarity threshold. New methods control errors sufficiently
               such that amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) can be resolved
               exactly, down to the level of single-nucleotide differences over
               the sequenced gene region. The benefits of finer resolution are
               immediately apparent, and arguments for ASV methods have focused
               on their improved resolution. Less obvious, but we believe more

              technologies can sequence the entire 16S rRNA gene, but higher

              to yield reliable and reproducible data that can be synthesized
              across studies will ultimately improve the scientific rigor and
              impact of published work and greatly benefit microbiome research.
              In this review, we identify and address several key elements of
              microbiome research: conceptual modeling and hypothesis framing;
              study design; experimental methodology and pitfalls; data
              analysis; and reporting considerations. Finally, we explore
              possible future directions and research opportunities. Our goal
              is to aid investigators who are interested in this burgeoning
              research area and hopefully provide the foundation for
              formulating consensus approaches in lung microbiome research.",

               Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models through Markov
               chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an
               adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized
               maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization
               methods such as the limited memory
               Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a
               platform for computing log densities and their gradients and
               Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as
               variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and marginal
               inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is
               set up so that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along
               with intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance
               probabilities, are easily accessible. Stan can be called from

  abstract  = "Background: Healthcare exposure results in significant
               microbiome disruption, particularly in the setting of critical
               illness, which may contribute to risk for healthcare-associated
               infections (HAIs). Patients admitted to long-term acute-care
               hospitals (LTACHs) have extensive prior healthcare exposure and
               critical illness; significant microbiome disruption has been
               previously documented among LTACH patients. We compared the
               predictive value of 3 respiratory tract microbiome disruption
               indices---bacterial community diversity, dominance, and absolute
               abundance---as they relate to risk for ventilator-associated
               pneumonia (VAP) and adverse ventilator-associated events (VAE),
               which commonly complicate LTACH care. Methods: We enrolled 83
               subjects on admission to an academic LTACH for ventilator
               weaning and performed longitudinal sampling of endotracheal
               aspirates, followed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing (Illumina
               HiSeq), bacterial community profiling (QIIME2) for diversity,
               and 16S rRNA quantitative PCR (qPCR) for total bacterial
               abundance. Statistical analyses were performed with R and Stan
               software. Mixed-effects models were fit to relate the admission
               MDIs to subsequent clinically diagnosed VAP and VAE. Results: Of
               the 83 patients, 19 had been diagnosed with pneumonia during the
               14 days prior to LTACH admission (ie, ``recent past VAP''); 23
               additional patients were receiving antibiotics consistent with
               empiric VAP therapy within 48 hours of admission (ie, ``empiric
               VAP therapy''); and 41 patients had no evidence of VAP at
               admission (ie, ``no suspected VAP''). We detected no
               statistically significant differences in admission Shannon
               diversity, maximum amplicon sequence variant (ASV)--level
               proportional abundance, or 16S qPCR across the variables of
               interest. In isolation, all 3 admission microbiome disruption
               indices showed poor predictive performance, though Shannon
               diversity performed better than maximum ASV abundance.
               Predictive models that combined (1) bacterial diversity or
               abundance with (2) recent prior VAP diagnosis and (3) concurrent
               antibiotic exposure best predicted 14-day VAP (type S error <
               0.05) and 30-day VAP (type S error < 0.003). In this cohort, VAE
               risk was paradoxically associated with higher admission Shannon
               diversity and lower admission maximum ASV abundance.
               Conclusions: In isolation, respiratory tract microbiome
               disruption indices obtained at LTACH admission showed poor
               predictive performance for subsequent VAP and VAE. But diversity
               and abundance models incorporating recent VAP history and
               admission antibiotic exposure performed well predicting 14-day
               and 30-day VAP. Disclosures: None Funding: None",

  abstract = "Pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality for which
              no new methods of treatment have entered clinical practice since
              the discovery of antibiotics. Innovations in the techniques of
              culture-independent microbial identification have shown that the
              lungs, previously deemed sterile in the absence of infection,
              contain diverse and dynamic communities of microbes. In this
              Personal View, we argue that these observations have shown the
              inadequacy of traditional conceptual models of lung microbiology
              and the pathogenesis of pneumonia, hampering progress in research
              and practice. We propose three new conceptual models to replace
              the traditional models of lung microbiology: an adapted island
              model of lung biogeography, the effect of environmental gradients
              on lung microbiota, and pneumonia as an emergent phenomenon
              propelled by unexplored positive feedback loops. We argue that
              the ecosystem of lung microbiota has all of the features of a
              complex adaptive system: diverse entities interacting with each
              other within a common space, showing interdependent actions and
              possessing the capacity to adapt to changes in conditions.
              Complex adaptive systems are fundamentally different in behaviour
              from the simple, linear systems typified by the traditional model

              active viable but unculturable bacteria. Novel high-throughput
              culture-independent techniques hold promise but have not been
              systematically compared to conventional culture. We analyzed 46
              clinically obtained bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid specimens
              from symptomatic and asymptomatic lung transplant recipients both
              by culture (using a clinical microbiology laboratory protocol)
              and by bacterial 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing. Bacteria were
              identified in 44 of 46 (95.7\%) BAL fluid specimens by
              culture-independent sequencing, significantly more than the
              number of specimens in which bacteria were detected (37 of 46,
              80.4\%, P $\leq$ 0.05) or ``pathogen'' species reported (18 of
              46, 39.1\%, P $\leq$ 0.0001) via culture. Identification of
              bacteria by culture was positively associated with
              culture-independent indices of infection (total bacterial DNA
              burden and low bacterial community diversity) (P $\leq$ 0.01). In
              BAL fluid specimens with no culture growth, the amount of
              bacterial DNA was greater than that in reagent and rinse
              controls, and communities were markedly dominated by select
              Gammaproteobacteria, notably Escherichia species and Pseudomonas
              fluorescens. Culture growth above the threshold of 10(4) CFU/ml
              was correlated with increased bacterial DNA burden (P < 0.01),
              decreased community diversity (P < 0.05), and increased relative
              abundance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P < 0.001). We present two
              case studies in which culture-independent techniques identified a
              respiratory pathogen missed by culture and clarified whether a
              cultured ``oral flora'' species represented a state of acute
              infection. In summary, we found that bacterial culture of BAL
              fluid is largely effective in discriminating acute infection from
              its absence and identified some specific limitations of BAL fluid
              culture in the diagnosis of pneumonia. We report the first

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Recent studies have revealed that bronchoalveolar
              lavage (BAL) fluid contains previously unappreciated communities
              of bacteria. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that host
              inflammatory signals prompt bacteria to disperse from
              cell-associated biofilms and adopt a virulent free-living
              phenotype. The proportion of the lung microbiota that is
              cell-associated is unknown. RESULTS: Forty-six BAL specimens were
              obtained from lung transplant recipients and divided into two
              aliquots: 'whole BAL' and 'acellular BAL,' the latter processed
              with a low-speed, short-duration centrifugation step. Both
              aliquots were analyzed via bacterial 16S rRNA gene
              pyrosequencing. The BAL specimens represented a wide spectrum of
              lung health, ranging from healthy and asymptomatic to acutely
              infected. Bacterial signal was detected in 52\% of acellular BAL
              aliquots, fewer than were detected in whole BAL (96\%, p $\leq$
              0.0001). Detection of bacteria in acellular BAL was associated
              with indices of acute infection [BAL neutrophilia, high total
              bacterial (16S) DNA, low community diversity, p < 0.01 for all]
              and, independently, with low relative abundance of specific
              taxonomic groups (p < 0.05). When whole and acellular aliquots
              from the same bronchoscopy were directly compared, acellular BAL
              contained fewer bacterial species (p < 0.05); whole and acellular
              BAL similarity was positively associated with evidence of
              infection and negatively associated with relative abundance of
              several prominent taxa (p < 0.001). Acellular BAL contained
              decreased relative abundance of Prevotella spp. (p < 0.05) and
              Pseudomonas fluorescens (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We present a
              novel methodological and analytical approach to the localization
              of lung microbiota and show that prominent members of the lung
              microbiome are cell-associated, potentially via biofilms, cell

              authentic microbial immigration, (i) dispersion along contiguous

              performed seven protected specimen brushings (PSB) and bilateral
              bronchoalveolar lavages (BALs) per subject. We amplified,

  abstract = "RATIONALE: The ``gut-lung axis'' is commonly invoked to explain
              the microbiome's influence on lung inflammation. Yet the lungs
              harbor their own microbiome, which is altered in respiratory
              disease. The relative influence of gut and lung bacteria on lung
              inflammation is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether
              baseline lung immune tone reflects local (lung-lung) or remote
              (gut-lung) microbe-host interactions. METHODS: We compared lung,
              tongue, and cecal bacteria in 40 healthy, genetically identical,
              10-week-old mice, using 16S ribosomal RNA gene quantification and
              sequencing. We measured inflammatory cytokines, using a multiplex
              assay of homogenized lung tissue. We compared lung bacteria in
              healthy mice treated with varied durations of systemic
              antibiotics. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Lung bacterial
              communities are highly variable among mice, cluster strongly by
              cage, shipment, and vendor, and are altered by antibiotics in a
              microbiologically predictable manner. Baseline lung
              concentrations of two key inflammatory cytokines (IL-1$\alpha$
              and IL-4) are correlated with the diversity and community
              composition of lung bacterial communities. Lung concentrations of
              these inflammatory cytokines correlate more strongly with
              variation in lung bacterial communities than with that of the gut
              or mouth. CONCLUSIONS: In the lungs of healthy mice, baseline
              innate immune tone more strongly reflects local (lung-lung)
              microbe-host interactions than remote (gut-lung) microbe-host
              interactions. Our results independently confirm the existence and
              immunologic significance of the murine lung microbiome, even in
              health. Variation in lung microbiota is likely an important,
              underappreciated source of experimental and clinical variability.

               studies have failed to demonstrate translocation of bacteria to

               culture-independent evidence that the lung microbiome is
               enriched with gut bacteria both in a murine model of sepsis and
               in humans with established ARDS. Following experimental sepsis,
               lung communities were dominated by viable gut-associated

              lung microbiome constitution in health is the balance of
              immigration and elimination of communities from the upper
              respiratory tract (URT; ``adapted island model of lung
              biogeography''), rather than differences in regional bacterial
              growth conditions. OBJECTIVES: To determine if the lung
              microbiome is spatially varied in healthy adults. METHODS:
              Bronchoscopy was performed on 15 healthy subjects. Specimens were
              sequentially collected in the lingula and right middle lobe (by
              bronchoalveolar lavage [BAL]), then in the right upper lobe, left
              upper lobe, and supraglottic space (by protected-specimen brush).
              Bacterial 16S ribosmal RNA-encoding genes were sequenced using
              MiSeq (Illumina, San Diego, CA). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:
              There were no significant differences between specimens collected
              by BAL and protected-specimen brush. Spatially separated
              intrapulmonary sites, when compared with each other, did not
              contain consistently distinct microbiota. On average,
              intrasubject variation was significantly less than intersubject
              variation (P = 0.00003). By multiple ecologic parameters
              (community richness, community composition, intersubject
              variability, and similarity to source community), right upper
              lobe microbiota more closely resembled those of the URT than did
              microbiota from more distal sites. As predicted by the adapted
              island model, community richness decreased with increasing
              distance from the source community of the URT (P < 0.05).
              CONCLUSIONS: In healthy lungs, spatial variation in microbiota
              within an individual is significantly less than variation across
              individuals. The lung microbiome in health is more influenced by
              microbial immigration and elimination (the adapted island model)
              than by the effects of local growth conditions on bacterial
              reproduction rates, which are more determinant in advanced lung
              diseases. BAL of a single lung segment is an acceptable method of

              features of the lung microbiome at the time of admission.Methods:
              We performed a prospective, observational cohort study in an ICU
              at a university hospital. Lung microbiota were quantified and
              characterized using droplet digital PCR and bacterial 16S
              ribosomal RNA gene quantification and sequencing. Primary
              predictors were the bacterial burden, community diversity, and
              community composition of lung microbiota. The primary outcome was
              ventilator-free days, determined at 28 days after
              admission.Measurements and Main Results: Lungs of 91 critically
              ill patients were sampled using miniature BAL within 24 hours of
              ICU admission. Patients with increased lung bacterial burden had
              fewer ventilator-free days (hazard ratio, 0.43; 95\% confidence
              interval, 0.21-0.88), which remained significant when the
              analysis was controlled for pneumonia and severity of illness.
              The community composition of lung bacteria predicted
              ventilator-free days (P = 0.003), driven by the presence of
              gut-associated bacteria (e.g., species of the Lachnospiraceae and
              Enterobacteriaceae families). Detection of gut-associated
              bacteria was also associated with the presence of acute
              respiratory distress syndrome.Conclusions: Key features of the
              lung microbiome (bacterial burden and enrichment with
              gut-associated bacteria) predict outcomes in critically ill
              patients. The lung microbiome is an understudied source of

              $\vartheta$1− $\vartheta$2) is calibrated using the Type 1 error
              rate, relying on the assumption that the true difference is zero,
              which makes no sense in many applications. We set up a more
              relevant framework in which a true comparison can be positive or
              negative, and, based on the data, you can state ``$\vartheta$1 >
              $\vartheta$2 with confidence,'' ``$\vartheta$2 > $\vartheta$1
              with confidence,'' or ``no claim with confidence.'' We focus on
              the Type S (for sign) error, which occurs when you claim
              ``$\vartheta$1 > $\vartheta$2 with confidence'' when
              $\vartheta$2> $\vartheta$1 (or vice-versa). We compute the Type S

              find that classical Type S error rates can be extremely high (up
              to 50\%). Bayesian confidence statements are conservative, in the
              sense that claims based on 95\% posterior intervals have Type S
              error rates between 0 and 2.5\%. For multiple comparison

                   Probabilistic programming languages make it easier to

  abstract = "PURPOSE: The ability to properly analyze and interpret large
              microbiome data sets has lagged behind our ability to acquire
              such data sets from environmental or clinical samples. Sequencing
              instruments impose a structure on these data: the natural sample
              space of a 16S rRNA gene sequencing data set is a simplex, which
              is a part of real space that is restricted to nonnegative values
              with a constant sum. Such data are compositional and should be
              analyzed using compositionally appropriate tools and approaches.
              However, most of the tools for 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis
              assume these data are unrestricted. METHODS: We show that
              existing tools for compositional data (CoDa) analysis can be
              readily adapted to analyze high-throughput sequencing data sets.
              RESULTS: The Human Microbiome Project tongue versus buccal mucosa
              data set shows how the CoDa approach can address the major
              elements of microbiome analysis. Reanalysis of a publicly
              available autism microbiome data set shows that the CoDa approach
              in concert with multiple hypothesis test corrections prevent
              false positive identifications. CONCLUSIONS: The CoDa approach is
              readily scalable to microbiome-sized analyses. We provide example
              code and make recommendations to improve the analysis and
              reporting of microbiome data sets.",

               (VAP) is common in the long-term acute-care hospital (LTACH)
               setting and may contribute to adverse ventilator-associated
               events (VAEs). Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common causative
               organism of VAP. We evaluated the impact of respiratory P.
               aeruginosa colonization and bacterial community dominance, both
               diagnosed and undiagnosed, on subsequent P. aeruginosa VAP and
               VAE events during long-term acute care. Methods: We enrolled 83
               patients on LTACH admission for ventilator weaning, performed
               longitudinal sampling of endotracheal aspirates followed by 16S
               rRNA gene sequencing (Illumina HiSeq), and bacterial community
               profiling (QIIME2). Statistical analysis was performed with R
               and Stan; mixed-effects models were fit to relate the abundance
               of respiratory Psa on admission to clinically diagnosed VAP and
               VAE events. Results: Of the 83 patients included, 12 were
               diagnosed with P. aeruginosa pneumonia during the 14 days prior
               to LTACH admission (known P. aeruginosa), and 22 additional
               patients received anti--P. aeruginosa antibiotics within 48
               hours of admission (suspected P. aeruginosa); 49 patients had no
               known or suspected P. aeruginosa (unknown P. aeruginosa). Among
               the known P. aeruginosa group, all 12 patients had P. aeruginosa
               detectable by 16S sequencing, with elevated admission P.
               aeruginosa proportional abundance (median, 0.97; IQR, 0.33--1).
               Among the suspected P. aeruginosa group, all 22 patients had P.
               aeruginosa detectable by 16S sequencing, with a wide range of
               admission P. aeruginosa proportional abundance (median, 0.0088;
               IQR, 0.00012--0.31). Of the 49 patients in the unknown group, 47
               also had detectable respiratory Psa, and many had high P.
               aeruginosa proportional abundance at admission (median, 0.014;
               IQR, 0.00025--0.52). Incident P. aeruginosa VAP was observed
               within 30 days in 4 of the known P. aeruginosa patients
               (33.3\%), 5 of the suspected P. aeruginosa patients (22.7\%),
               and 8 of the unknown P. aeruginosa patients (16.3\%). VAE was
               observed within 30 days in 1 of the known P. aeruginosa patients
               (8.3\%), 2 of the suspected P. aeruginosa patients (9.1\%), and
               1 of the unknown P. aeruginosa patients (2\%). Admission P.
               aeruginosa abundance was positively associated with VAP and VAE
               risk in all groups, but the association only achieved
               statistical significance in the unknown group (type S error
               <0.002 for 30-day VAP and <0.011 for 30-day VAE). Conclusions:
               We identified a high prevalence of unrecognized respiratory P.
               aeruginosa colonization among patients admitted to LTACH for
               weaning from mechanical ventilation. The admission P. aeruginosa
               proportional abundance was strongly associated with increased
               risk of incident P. aeruginosa VAP among these patients.

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is a major
              contributor to respiratory failure requiring intubation and
              mechanical ventilation. LRTI also occurs during mechanical
              ventilation, increasing the morbidity and mortality of intubated
              patients. We sought to understand the dynamics of respiratory
              tract microbiota following intubation and the relationship
              between microbial community structure and infection. RESULTS: We
              enrolled a cohort of 15 subjects with respiratory failure
              requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation from the medical
              intensive care unit at an academic medical center. Oropharyngeal
              (OP) and deep endotracheal (ET) secretions were sampled within 24
              h of intubation and every 48-72 h thereafter. Bacterial community
              profiling was carried out by purifying DNA, PCR amplification of
              16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequences, deep sequencing, and
              bioinformatic community analysis. We compared enrolled subjects
              to a cohort of healthy subjects who had lower respiratory tract
              sampling by bronchoscopy. In contrast to the diverse upper
              respiratory tract and lower respiratory tract microbiota found in
              healthy controls, critically ill subjects had lower initial
              diversity at both sites. Diversity further diminished over time
              on the ventilator. In several subjects, the bacterial community
              was dominated by a single taxon over multiple time points. The
              clinical diagnosis of LRTI ascertained by chart review correlated
              with low community diversity and dominance of a single taxon.
              Dominant taxa matched clinical bacterial cultures where cultures
              were obtained and positive. In several cases, dominant taxa
              included bacteria not detected by culture, including Ureaplasma
              parvum and Enterococcus faecalis. CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal
              analysis of respiratory tract microbiota in critically ill
              patients provides insight into the pathogenesis and diagnosis of
              LRTI. 16S rRNA gene sequencing of endotracheal aspirate samples

              optimizing experimental design and avoiding known pitfalls,
              organized in the typical order in which studies are carried out.
              We first review best practices in experimental design and
              introduce common confounders such as age, diet, antibiotic use,
              pet ownership, longitudinal instability, and microbial sharing
              during cohousing in animal studies. Typically, samples will need
              to be stored, so we provide data on best practices for several
              sample types. We then discuss design and analysis of positive and
              negative controls, which should always be run with experimental
              samples. We introduce a convenient set of non-biological DNA
              sequences that can be useful as positive controls for high-volume
              analysis. Careful analysis of negative and positive controls is
              particularly important in studies of samples with low microbial
              biomass, where contamination can comprise most or all of a
              sample. Lastly, we summarize approaches to enhancing experimental
              robustness by careful control of multiple comparisons and to
              comparing discovery and validation cohorts. We hope the

              A growing body of research now examines the role of the
              microbiome in patients with critical illness, such as sepsis and
              acute respiratory failure. In this article, we provide an
              introduction to microbiome concepts and terminology and we
              systematically review the current evidence base of the
              critical-illness microbiome, including 51 studies in animal
              models and pediatric and adult critically ill patients. We

              samples from mechanically-ventilated patients. We performed 16S
              rRNA gene sequencing to characterize upper and lower respiratory
              tract microbiota and classified patients into host-response
              subphenotypes based on clinical variables and plasma biomarkers
              of innate immunity and inflammation. We derived diversity metrics
              and composition clusters with Dirichlet Multinomial Models (DMM)
              and examined for associations with subphenotypes and clinical
              outcomes. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Oral and ETA microbial
              communities from 301 mechanically-ventilated subjects had
              substantial heterogeneity in alpha- and beta-diversity. DMM
              revealed a cluster with low alpha-diversity and enrichment for
              pathogens (e.g. high Staphylococcus or Pseudomonadaceae relative
              abundance) in 35\% of ETA samples, associated with a
              hyperinflammatory subphenotype, worse 30-day survival and longer
              time-to-liberation from mechanical ventilation (adjusted p<0.05),
              compared to patients with higher alpha-diversity and relative
              abundance of typical oral microbiota. Patients with evidence of
              dysbiosis (low alpha diversity and low relative abundance of
              ``protective'' oral-origin commensal bacteria) in both oral and
              ETA samples (17\%, combined dysbiosis) had significantly worse
              30-day survival and time-to-liberation compared to patients
              without dysbiosis (55\%, adjusted p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS:
              Respiratory tract dysbiosis may represent an important,
              modifiable contributor to patient-level heterogeneity in systemic
              inflammatory responses and clinical outcomes.",

              identification of causative pathogens by cultures, which require
              extended incubation periods and have limited sensitivity.
              Next-generation sequencing of microbial DNA directly from patient
              samples may improve diagnostic accuracy for guiding antibiotic
              prescriptions. In this study, we hypothesized that enhanced
              pathogen detection using sequencing can improve upon
              culture-based diagnosis and that certain sequencing profiles
              correlate with host response. We prospectively collected
              endotracheal aspirates and plasma within 72 h of intubation from
              patients with acute respiratory failure. We performed 16S rRNA
              gene sequencing to determine pathogen abundance in lung samples
              and measured plasma biomarkers to assess host responses to
              detected pathogens. Among 56 patients, 12 patients (21\%) had
              positive respiratory cultures. Sequencing revealed lung
              communities with low diversity (p 50\% relative abundance)
              corresponding to clinically isolated pathogens (concordance p =
              0.009). Importantly, sequencing detected dominant pathogens in
              20\% of the culture-negative patients exposed to broad-spectrum
              empiric antibiotics. Regardless of culture results, pathogen
              dominance correlated with increased plasma markers of host injury
              (receptor of advanced glycation end-products-RAGE) and
              inflammation (interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor receptor
              1-TNFR1) (p < 0.05), compared to subjects without dominant
              pathogens in their lung communities. Machine-learning algorithms
              identified pathogen abundance by sequencing as the most
              informative predictor of culture positivity. Thus, enhanced
              detection of pathogenic bacteria by sequencing improves etiologic
              diagnosis of pneumonia, correlates with host responses, and
              offers substantial opportunity for individualized therapeutic
              targeting and antimicrobial stewardship. Clinical translation
              will require validation with rapid whole meta-genome sequencing

  title    = "Does this patient have ventilator-associated pneumonia?",
  author   = "Klompas, Michael",
  abstract = "CONTEXT: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a common and
              serious nosocomial infection. Accurate, timely diagnosis enables
              affected patients to receive appropriate therapy and avoids
              mistreatment of patients having other conditions. OBJECTIVE: To
              review the published medical literature describing the precision
              and accuracy of clinical, radiographic, and laboratory data to
              diagnose bacterial VAP relative to a histological gold standard.
              DATA SOURCES: English-language articles identified by a
              structured search strategy using MEDLINE (January 1966-October
              31, 2006) and Google Scholar. Additional articles were identified
              through the reference lists of studies and review papers
              identified by the search strategy. STUDY SELECTION: Included
              studies described clinical findings associated with VAP in 25 or
              more patients receiving mechanical ventilation who subsequently
              underwent pulmonary biopsy or autopsy. Fourteen studies
              describing clinical findings in 655 patients met inclusion
              criteria. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were abstracted onto a structured
              form, allowing calculation of the likelihood ratios (LRs) for
              each sign or combination of findings. DATA SYNTHESIS: The
              presence or absence of fever, abnormal white blood cell count, or
              purulent pulmonary secretions do not substantively alter the
              probability of VAP. However, the combination of a new
              radiographic infiltrate with at least 2 of fever, leukocytosis,
              or purulent sputum increases the likelihood of VAP (summary LR,
              2.8; 95\% confidence interval, 0.97-7.9). The absence of a new
              infiltrate on a plain chest radiograph lowers the likelihood of
              VAP (summary LR, 0.35; 95\% confidence interval, 0.14-0.87).
              Fewer than 50\% neutrophils on cell count analysis of lower
              pulmonary secretions makes VAP unlikely (LR range, 0.05-0.10).
              CONCLUSIONS: Routine bedside evaluation coupled with radiographic
              information provides suggestive but not definitive evidence that
              VAP is present or absent. Given the severity of VAP and the
              frequency of serious conditions that can mimic VAP, clinicians
              should be ready to consider additional tests that provide further
              evidence for VAP or that establish another diagnosis.",

  abstract = "Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) lead to more deaths
              each year than any other infectious disease category. Despite
              this, etiologic LRTI pathogens are infrequently identified due to
              limitations of existing microbiologic tests. In critically ill
              patients, noninfectious inflammatory syndromes resembling LRTIs
              further complicate diagnosis. To address the need for improved
              LRTI diagnostics, we performed metagenomic next-generation
              sequencing (mNGS) on tracheal aspirates from 92 adults with acute
              respiratory failure and simultaneously assessed pathogens, the
              airway microbiome, and the host transcriptome. To differentiate
              pathogens from respiratory commensals, we developed a rules-based
              model (RBM) and logistic regression model (LRM) in a derivation
              cohort of 20 patients with LRTIs or noninfectious acute
              respiratory illnesses. When tested in an independent validation
              cohort of 24 patients, both models achieved accuracies of 95.5\%.
              We next developed pathogen, microbiome diversity, and host gene
              expression metrics to identify LRTI-positive patients and
              differentiate them from critically ill controls with
              noninfectious acute respiratory illnesses. When tested in the
              validation cohort, the pathogen metric performed with an area
              under the receiver-operating curve (AUC) of 0.96 (95\% CI,
              0.86-1.00), the diversity metric with an AUC of 0.80 (95\% CI,

              of 0.88 (95\% CI, 0.75-1.00). Combining these achieved a negative
              predictive value of 100\%. This study suggests that a single
              streamlined protocol offering an integrated genomic portrait of
              pathogen, microbiome, and host transcriptome may hold promise as
              a tool for LRTI diagnosis.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Recent studies have suggested that bacteria
              associated with the placenta-a ``placental microbiome''-may be
              important in reproductive health and disease. However, a
              challenge in working with specimens with low bacterial biomass,
              such as placental samples, is that some or all of the bacterial
              DNA may derive from contamination in dust or commercial reagents.
              To investigate this, we compared placental samples from healthy
              deliveries to a matched set of contamination controls, as well as
              to oral and vaginal samples from the same women. RESULTS: We
              quantified total 16S rRNA gene copies using quantitative PCR and
              found that placental samples and negative controls contained low
              and indistinguishable copy numbers. Oral and vaginal swab
              samples, in contrast, showed higher copy numbers. We carried out
              16S rRNA gene sequencing and community analysis and found no
              separation between communities from placental samples and
              contamination controls, though oral and vaginal samples showed
              characteristic, distinctive composition. Two different DNA
              purification methods were compared with similar conclusions,
              though the composition of the contamination background differed.
              Authentically present microbiota should yield mostly similar
              results regardless of the purification method used-this was seen
              for oral samples, but no placental bacterial lineages were (1)
              shared between extraction methods, (2) present at >1 \% of the
              total, and (3) present at greater abundance in placental samples
              than contamination controls. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that for
              this sample set, using the methods described, we could not
              distinguish between placental samples and contamination
              introduced during DNA purification.",

  abstract = "The successional dynamics of microbial communities are influenced
              by the synergistic interactions of physical and biological
              factors. In our motivating data, ocean microbiome samples were
              collected from the Santa Cruz Municipal Wharf, Monterey Bay at
              multiple time points and then 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequenced.
              We develop a Bayesian semiparametric regression model to
              investigate how microbial abundance and succession change with
              covarying physical and biological factors including algal bloom
              and domoic acid concentration level using 16S rRNA sequencing
              data. A generalized linear regression model is built using the
              Laplace prior, a sparse inducing prior, to improve estimation of
              covariate effects on mean abundances of microbial species
              represented by operational taxonomic units (OTUs). A
              nonparametric prior model is used to facilitate borrowing
              strength across OTUs, across samples and across time points. It
              flexibly estimates baseline mean abundances of OTUs and provides
              the basis for improved quantification of covariate effects. The
              proposed method does not require prior normalization of OTU
              counts to adjust differences in sample total counts. Instead, the
              normalization and estimation of covariate effects on OTU
              abundance are simultaneously carried out for joint analysis of
              all OTUs. Using simulation studies and a real data analysis, we
              demonstrate improved inference compared to an existing method.",

               today's model-based statistics, the book pushes readers to
               perform step-by-step calculations that are usually automated.
               This unique computational approach ensures that readers
               understand enough of the details to make reasonable choices and
               interpretations in their own modeling work. The text presents
               generalized linear multilevel models from a Bayesian
               perspective, relying on a simple logical interpretation of
               Bayesian probability and maximum entropy. It covers from the
               basics of regression to multilevel models. The author also
               discusses measurement error, missing data, and Gaussian process
               models for spatial and network autocorrelation. By using
               complete R code examples throughout, this book provides a
               practical foundation for performing statistical inference.
               Designed for both PhD students and seasoned professionals in the

  abstract = "RATIONALE: Hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) is a common
              treatment for hematological neoplasms and autoimmune disorders.
              Among HCT recipients, pulmonary complications are common, morbid,
              and/or lethal, and they have recently been associated with gut
              dysbiosis. The role of lung microbiota in post-HCT pulmonary
              complications is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the role of
              lung microbiota in post-HCT pulmonary complications using animal
              modeling and human BAL fluid. METHODS: For animal modeling, we
              used an established murine model of HCT with and without
              postengraftment herpes virus infection. For human studies, we
              characterized lung microbiota in BAL fluid from 43 HCT
              recipients. Lung bacteria were characterized using 16S ribosomal
              RNA gene sequencing and were compared with lung histology
              (murine) and with alveolar inflammation and pulmonary function
              testing (human). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Both HCT and
              viral infection independently altered the composition of murine
              lung microbiota, but they had no effect on lung microbial
              diversity. By contrast, combined HCT and viral infection
              profoundly altered lung microbiota, decreasing community
              diversity with an associated pneumonitis. Among human HCT
              recipients, increased relative abundance of the Proteobacteria
              phylum was associated with impaired pulmonary function, and lung
              microbiota were significantly associated with alveolar
              concentrations of inflammatory cytokines. CONCLUSIONS: In animal
              models and human subjects, lung dysbiosis is a prominent feature
              of HCT. Lung dysbiosis is correlated with histologic,
              immunologic, and physiologic features of post-HCT pulmonary
              complications. Our findings suggest the lung microbiome may be an
              unappreciated target for the prevention and treatment of post-HCT

              of CRPA infection. Prior studies have not examined relationships
              between the microbiota, medications, and CRPA colonization
              acquisition. METHODS: Data and perirectal swabs were obtained
              from a cohort of ICU patients at the University of Maryland
              Medical Center. Patients (N = 109) were classified into 3 groups
              by CRPA colonization-acquisition status and antimicrobial
              exposure. We conducted 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing of an
              ICU admission swab and $\geq$1 additional swab and evaluated
              associations between patient characteristics, medications, the
              gastrointestinal microbiota, and CRPA colonization acquisition.
              RESULTS: ICU patients had low levels of diversity and high
              relative abundances of pathobionts. Piperacillin-tazobactam was
              prescribed more frequently to patients with CRPA colonization
              acquisition than those without. Piperacillin-tazobactam was
              associated with low abundance of potentially protective taxa (eg,
              Lactobacillus and Clostridiales) and increased risk of
              Enterococcus domination (odds ratio [OR], 5.50; 95\% confidence
              interval [CI], 2.03-14.92). Opioids were associated with
              dysbiosis in patients who did not receive antibiotics;
              potentially protective Blautia and Lactobacillus were higher in
              patients who did not receive opioids. Several correlated taxa,
              identified at ICU admission, were associated with lower risk of
              CRPA colonization acquisition (OR, 0.58; 95\% CI, .38-.87).
              CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotics differed in their impact on the
              microbiota, with piperacillin-tazobactam being particularly
              damaging. Certain bacterial taxa (eg, Clostridiales) were
              negatively associated with CRPA colonization acquisition. These

                   benefit from a decision theoretically justified two-stage
                   approach: first, construct a possibly non-sparse model that
                   predicts well, and then find a minimal subset of features
                   that characterize the predictions. The model built in the
                   first step is referred to as the
                   \textbackslashemph\{reference model\} and the operation
                   during the latter step as predictive
                   \textbackslashemph\{projection\}. The key characteristic of
                   this approach is that it finds an excellent tradeoff between
                   sparsity and predictive accuracy, and the gain comes from
                   utilizing all available information including prior and that
                   coming from the left out features. We review several methods

                   contributions. We present a new projection technique that
                   unifies two existing techniques and is both accurate and

                   other shrinkage priors",
  author        = "Piironen, Juho and Vehtari, Aki",
  abstract      = "The horseshoe prior has proven to be a noteworthy
                   alternative for sparse Bayesian estimation, but has
                   previously suffered from two problems. First, there has been
                   no systematic way of specifying a prior for the global
                   shrinkage hyperparameter based on the prior information
                   about the degree of sparsity in the parameter vector.
                   Second, the horseshoe prior has the undesired property that
                   there is no possibility of specifying separately information
                   about sparsity and the amount of regularization for the
                   largest coefficients, which can be problematic with weakly
                   identified parameters, such as the logistic regression
                   coefficients in the case of data separation. This paper
                   proposes solutions to both of these problems. We introduce a
                   concept of effective number of nonzero parameters, show an
                   intuitive way of formulating the prior for the global
                   hyperparameter based on the sparsity assumptions, and argue
                   that the previous default choices are dubious based on their
                   tendency to favor solutions with more unshrunk parameters
                   than we typically expect a priori. Moreover, we introduce a
                   generalization to the horseshoe prior, called the
                   regularized horseshoe, that allows us to specify a minimum
                   level of regularization to the largest values. We show that
                   the new prior can be considered as the continuous
                   counterpart of the spike-and-slab prior with a finite slab
                   width, whereas the original horseshoe resembles the
                   spike-and-slab with an infinitely wide slab. Numerical
                   experiments on synthetic and real world data illustrate the
                   benefit of both of these theoretical advances.",

              of 264 patients were submitted to mechanical ventilation (MV) for
              more than 48 hours. Fifty-eight (21.9 percent) patients developed
              a bacterial pneumonia after a mean of 7.9 days (range, 2 to 40
              days) of MV. In addition, they were ten superinfections in nine
              patients, raising the mean incidence to 25.7 percent. Five
              patients developed secondary bacteremia, and another five had
              septic shock. Identification of the causative agent of pneumonia
              was possible in 47 episodes by means of highly specific
              techniques (telescoping plugged catheter, blood cultures, and/or
              necropsy). Thirteen (27.6 percent) of these cases were
              polymicrobial. The predominant pathogens isolated in the first
              episode of pneumonia were Gram-negative bacilli (62.6 percent),
              but a high incidence of Staphylococcus aureus infection (23.2
              percent) was detected. Gram-negative bacilli represented 66.6
              percent of the total organisms isolated in superinfections. The
              mortality rate in the pneumonia group was 42 percent; this
              percentage is similar to mortality rate among MV patients without
              pneumonia (37 percent). We conclude that nosocomial pneumonia is
              a frequent complication of MV in the medical-surgical ICU.

              fatality in critically ill patients with a high mortality rate

              unrestricted search of the English language medical literature.
              For each individual study, the relative risk of VAP was
              calculated using the reported primary outcome data. RESULTS: The
              search identified a total of 72 articles. Eight articles
              enrolling a total of 1229 patients fulfilled the inclusion and
              exclusion criteria. In four trials, the investigators were
              blinded for the intervention, and two trials used an
              intention-to-treat analysis. Loss to follow-up with regard to the
              primary endpoint ranged from 0 to 14\% in the intervention groups
              and from 0 to 16\% in the control groups. The incidence of VAP
              expressed as the percentage of studied patients was reported in
              seven trials. The incidence of VAP ranged from 4 to 36\% in the
              intervention groups and from 13 to 50\% in the control groups.
              The relative risk for VAP ranged between 0.30 and 1.41. Three
              trials showed a significant difference in favor of probiotic
              therapy between the intervention and the control groups.
              CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of VAP tended to be lower in patients
              treated with probiotics in most trials identified by the
              systematic search. Due to the heterogeneity of the studies and
              the low quality of evidence, it remains difficult to draw firm
              conclusions. The efficacy of preventive probiotics should be
              studied in more detail in future trials. Application of
              probiotics for the prevention of VAP seems to be safe with only
              few side effects reported in the selected trials.",

              infections. OBJECTIVE: To provide an up-to-date, international
              picture of the extent and patterns of infection in ICUs. DESIGN,
              SETTING, AND PATIENTS: The Extended Prevalence of Infection in
              Intensive Care (EPIC II) study, a 1-day, prospective, point
              prevalence study with follow-up conducted on May 8, 2007.
              Demographic, physiological, bacteriological, therapeutic, and
              outcome data were collected for 14,414 patients in 1265
              participating ICUs from 75 countries on the study day. Analyses
              focused on the data from the 13,796 adult (>18 years) patients.
              RESULTS: On the day of the study, 7087 of 13,796 patients (51\%)
              were considered infected; 9084 (71\%) were receiving antibiotics.
              The infection was of respiratory origin in 4503 (64\%), and
              microbiological culture results were positive in 4947 (70\%) of
              the infected patients; 62\% of the positive isolates were
              gram-negative organisms, 47\% were gram-positive, and 19\% were
              fungi. Patients who had longer ICU stays prior to the study day
              had higher rates of infection, especially infections due to
              resistant staphylococci, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas species, and
              Candida species. The ICU mortality rate of infected patients was
              more than twice that of noninfected patients (25\% [1688/6659] vs
              11\% [ 682/6352], respectively; P < .001), as was the hospital
              mortality rate (33\% [2201/6659] vs 15\% [ 942/6352],

              mortality, 1.51; 95\% confidence interval, 1.36-1.68; P < .001).
              CONCLUSIONS: Infections are common in patients in contemporary
              ICUs, and risk of infection increases with duration of ICU stay.
              In this large cohort, infection was independently associated with
              an increased risk of hospital death.",

               importance sampling to efficiently compute the required
               leave-one-out posterior distributions. We compare stacking of
               predictive distributions to several alternatives: stacking of
               means, Bayesian model averaging (BMA), Pseudo-BMA, and a variant
               of Pseudo-BMA that is stabilized using the Bayesian bootstrap.
               Based on simulations and real-data applications, we recommend
               stacking of predictive distributions, with
               bootstrapped-Pseudo-BMA as an approximate alternative when
               computation cost is an issue.",

  abstract = "The signing authors together with the journal Systematic and
              Applied Microbiology (SAM) have started an ambitious project that
              has been conceived to provide a useful tool especially for the
              scientific microbial taxonomist community. The aim of what we
              have called ``The All-Species Living Tree'' is to reconstruct a
              single 16S rRNA tree harboring all sequenced type strains of the
              hitherto classified species of Archaea and Bacteria. This tree is
              to be regularly updated by adding the species with validly
              published names that appear monthly in the Validation and
              Notification lists of the International Journal of Systematic and
              Evolutionary Microbiology. For this purpose, the SAM executive
              editors, together with the responsible teams of the ARB, SILVA,
              and LPSN projects (www.arb-home.de, www.arb-silva.de, and
              www.bacterio.cict.fr, respectively), have prepared a 16S rRNA
              database containing over 6700 sequences, each of which represents
              a single type strain of a classified species up to 31 December
              2007. The selection of sequences had to be undertaken manually
              due to a high error rate in the names and information fields
              provided for the publicly deposited entries. In addition, from
              among the often occurring multiple entries for a single type
              strain, the best-quality sequence was selected for the project.
              The living tree database that SAM now provides contains corrected
              entries and the best-quality sequences with a manually checked
              alignment. The tree reconstruction has been performed by using
              the maximum likelihood algorithm RAxML. The tree provided in the
              first release is a result of the calculation of a single dataset
              containing 9975 single entries, 6728 corresponding to type strain
              gene sequences, as well as 3247 additional high-fquality
              sequences to give robustness to the reconstruction. Trees are
              dynamic structures that change on the basis of the quality and
              availability of the data used for their calculation. Therefore,
              the addition of new type strain sequences in further subsequent
              releases may help to resolve certain branching orders that appear
              ambiguous in this first release. On the web sites:
              www.elsevier.de/syapm and www.arb-silva.de/living-tree, the
              All-Species Living Tree team will release a regularly updated
              database compatible with the ARB software environment containing
              the whole 16S rRNA dataset used to reconstruct ``The All-Species
              Living Tree''. As a result, the latest reconstructed phylogeny
              will be provided. In addition to the ARB file, a readable
              multi-FASTA universal sequence editor file with the complete
              alignment will be provided for those not using ARB. There is also
              a complete set of supplementary tables and figures illustrating
              the selection procedure and its outcome. It is expected that the
              All-Species Living Tree will help to improve future
              classification efforts by simplifying the selection of the
              correct type strain sequences. For queries, information updates,
              remarks on the dataset or tree reconstructions shown, a contact
              email address has been created (living-tree@arb-silva.de). This
              provides an entry point for anyone from the scientific community
              to provide additional input for the construction and improvement
              of the first tree compiling all sequenced type strains of all
              prokaryotic species for which names had been validly published.",
